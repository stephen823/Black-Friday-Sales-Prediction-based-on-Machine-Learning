# Black-Friday-Sales-Prediction-based-on-Machine-Learning

# Project Intro/Objective
This project aims to analyze how demographic factors influences Black Friday Sales at a retail store through data visualization and predict future Black Friday sales using rigorously chosen machine learning models.

# Methods Used
* Data Visualization
* Machine Learning
* Inferential Statistics

# Technologies
* Python
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* Jupyter

# Project Description
After cleansing and transforming data into the analytic-ready form, extensive visualization and statistical inferencing are implemented to analyze each demographic factor's impact on Balck Friday sales and determine the suitable model for machine learning. The most fitting model predicts future black Friday sales based on test data after rigorous comparison of machine learning models and subsequent tuning of hyperparameters.
